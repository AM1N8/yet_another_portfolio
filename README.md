# Portfolio foundation

Next.js App Router with strict TypeScript and a server-only, validated content layer.
Use Node.js 22.18+ and npm.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Checks

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
npm run format:check
```

## Content

`content/portfolio.yaml` is the only personal-content source. The flow is:

```text
portfolio.yaml → YAML parser → Zod schema → inferred Portfolio → Server Components
```

Server Components import `loadPortfolio` from `lib/content/loadPortfolio.ts`.
Import types from `lib/content/types.ts` using `import type`; do not parse YAML in
components or import the loader into Client Components. The `server-only` guard
enforces that boundary. ESLint also prohibits YAML parser imports in `app/` and
`components/`.

The root layout loads the content during prerendering, so invalid required fields
fail production builds with the filename and field paths. YAML syntax errors also
include parser diagnostics. Optional fields accept missing/null values, optional
text and links may be empty, and optional lists default to empty arrays. No missing
personal facts are generated. Unknown keys and duplicate project/experiment slugs
are rejected. External URLs must use HTTP(S); media and résumé resources may also
use root-relative paths. Dates accept valid `YYYY`, `YYYY-MM`, or `YYYY-MM-DD` values.

Only Phase 0 and Phase 1 are implemented. The index route is an empty server-rendered
scaffold for subsequent work. See `DESIGN.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `TASKS.md` for the
design direction, contribution rules, and remaining phases.
